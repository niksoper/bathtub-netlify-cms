It had been far too long, but on Sunday 17th October2021, after all of the disruption of the pandemic we finally made a return to live performing with a free concert in Alice Park.

And here is a clip:

We were a bit worried about getting rained off, but our friends at the Alice Park Cafe provided us with cover and the sun was shining like a warm spring day.
