My name is Scott and I moved to Bath from Sydney Australia in 2018. Literally the first thing I did when I arrived was sign up to this new orchestra that was being formed.  I love the idea and feeling of playing in such a big ensemble with a mixture of abilities, which I did as a teenager as part of the world's first amateur production of Evita.  I have played guitar for nearly 40 years now,  but in 2010 I broke a finger bone into 7 pieces playing Australian Rules Football.  It took over a year before I could play guitar again but I got there eventually! I now suffer from chronic arthritis in both of my hands which limits  what I can do these days, and prevents me from playing altogether every now and then.  In addition to playing with BathTub Orchestra I also write, record and occasionally release my own original music which can be found at <a href="https://scottoharamusic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scottoharamusic.com</a>.
