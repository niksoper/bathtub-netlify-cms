I started learning the flute about a decade ago, but eventually stopped playing to focus on my GCSEs. A decade later, in-between university semesters, I decided to try again and it all returned to me. Once I got back on campus I danced in a c√®ilidh (a traditional Scottish/Irish dance), and found myself joining the wonderful [Southampton Folk Society](https://www.facebook.com/SotonFolkSoc/), where I learned to perform music for others.

However, that was my final year at university, and I had decided to move to Bath for work. This meant saying goodbye to my fellow folk musicians. Fortunately, not long after moving I discovered the BathTub Orchestra from a post on the Meetup app. I went along, was rather nervous, but I quickly warmed up to the challenge and felt very welcome!

Since then we have put on a large number of concerts covering all sorts of music from pop songs, jazz, blues, film soundtracks, to classical favourites. I have definitely grown as a musician and have also recorded many of our concerts, which you can find uploaded to YouTube and posted to [my blog](https://consto.uk/).
